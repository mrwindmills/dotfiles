file: $ZSH_DOTFILES_DIR/aliases.d/README.md

This is the folder where you should place your aliases files.
Just touch your new aliases file, name it after the command you are aliasing,
and give it a 'zal' extension to ease identifying its contents.

Here you are an example of aliases file content:

```sh
# vim:ft=zsh
# File: $ZSH_DOTFILES_DIR/aliases.d/juju.zal
# Contents: juju aliases

alias jjb='juju bootstrap'
```
